# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Executive Leadership Team  
**FROM:** Mark Ohrvall, Chief Revenue Officer  
**DATE:** February 6, 2026  
**RE:** Assessment of Scott Pallardy Resignation - Revenue Impact Analysis

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Assessment: LOW-TO-MODERATE CONCERN**

Scott Pallardy's resignation, while requiring immediate action, does not represent a material threat to Q1 2026 revenue targets. The primary risks are manageable with proper transition execution.

---

## QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

### Scott's Position Relative to Peers

| Metric | Scott Pallardy | Team Average | Variance |
|--------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Revenue Rank | **10th of 13** | - | Bottom quartile |
| Total Opportunities | 7 | 9.8 | -29% |
| Total Pipeline Value | $283K | $548K | **-48%** |
| Total Book Value | $373K | $875K | **-57%** |
| EGP Margin | 61% | ~40% | +21% |

**Key Finding:** Scott carries the smallest active book on the sales team. His departure removes less than 4% of total team pipeline.

### Revenue at Risk Assessment

| Category | Amount | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|----------|--------|------------|------------|
| Active Pipeline | $283K | LOW | Strong bench coverage |
| Stage 4 Deals (Feb closes) | $183K | MEDIUM | Immediate handoff required |
| Dormant Accounts (2024 revenue) | $6.3M | **HIGH** | Proactive re-engagement |
| **Total Exposure** | **$6.8M** | | |

## RISK FACTORS

### Concerns Requiring Attention

1. **Dormant Account Churn Risk ($6.3M)**
   - 8 accounts with 2024 revenue but zero current pipeline
   - Biogen ($1.5M), Atara ($1.08M), Shire/Takeda ($1.0M) require immediate outreach
   - Without proactive engagement, these accounts may not return in 2026

2. **Single-Threaded Relationships**
   - Arthrex (Dallis) - contact going on parental leave
   - Enable Injections (Ryan) - deal lost, relationship salvageable
   - BioCryst - Stage 4 deal with NO recorded customer calls (blind spot)

3. **Transition Timing**
   - 3 deals closing by Feb 28 ($183K total)
   - 80% of pipeline aging 90+ days (needs acceleration)

### Mitigating Factors

1. **Strong Bench Availability**
   - Lisa Burgese Fry: 15 opps / $1.28M book - has capacity, East region expertise
   - Jim Macdonell: Already involved in several Scott accounts
   - Avani Macwan: Top performer, pharma expertise

2. **Delivery Team Continuity**
   - Rathina G. (Technical Lead) - HIGH involvement, customer relationships intact
   - John (Solutions Architect) - HIGH involvement across accounts
   - These relationships provide bridge during AM transition

3. **Partner Coverage**
   - Zimmer Biomet covered through PTC partnership (Mike)
   - Partner channel provides continuity independent of AM

4. **High-Margin, Low-Complexity Book**
   - Scott's accounts are quality-focused (61% EGP margin)
   - Services are standard (AI Governance, Validation, Veeva)
   - No highly customized or at-risk implementations

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Week 1)
- [ ] Transfer all Salesforce opportunity ownership
- [ ] Lisa Burgese Fry assumes primary coverage
- [ ] Exit interview: Capture BioCryst contact information
- [ ] Call Dallis (Arthrex) before parental leave

### Short-Term (Weeks 2-4)
- [ ] Close Stage 4 deals: BioCryst ($89K), Therakos ($24K), BioAgilytix ($70K)
- [ ] Schedule intro calls: Biogen, AbbVie, Atara (dormant accounts)
- [ ] Qualify all Stage 1 opportunities (34 deals need review)

### Medium-Term (90 Days)
- [ ] Re-engage all 8 dormant accounts
- [ ] Rebuild pipeline to $1M+ (from $283K)
- [ ] Establish weekly cadence with top 15 accounts

---

## CONCLUSION

Scott Pallardy's resignation is **operationally manageable** for three reasons:

1. **Smallest book on team** - Less than 4% of total pipeline
2. **Strong replacement options** - Lisa Burgese Fry is ideal successor
3. **Delivery relationships intact** - Technical team maintains customer continuity

However, I am flagging the **$6.3M dormant account exposure** as a watch item. These accounts require proactive outreach within 30 days to prevent competitive displacement.

**Recommended Classification:** Standard Attrition  
**Revenue Forecast Impact:** Minimal if transition executed per playbook  
**Watch Item:** Dormant account re-engagement
